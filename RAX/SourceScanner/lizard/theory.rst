Cyclomatic Complexity
=====================

Counting the Cyclomatic Complexity Number is one of the most early and fundamental function
of Lizard. You can get more information about cyclomatic complexity from
`<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity>`_.

The default way Lizard counts the CCN is mostly compatible with McCabe's theory
(McCabe 1976 `<http://www.mccabe.com/pdf/mccabe-nist235r.pdf>`_), except that the
switch/case structure is counted by number of cases instead of switch. If you want
to strictly count by McCabe's definition, there's a Lizard extension to do that:

::

    lizard -Emccabe

There's still an open issue that needs to be fixed. Forever loops, or loops without
a condition shouldn't be counted.

Below are some language specific notes about CCN.


CCN for Nested Functions (Closures) and Classes
-----------------------------------------------

Within function definitions,
nested constructs, such as functions, closures, and structs,
are not part of the control flow graph of the function.
There is no definitive approach to account for the complexity of these nested constructs.

One obvious way is to consider the nested complexity separately,
as is currently done for Python.

The second approach is to add the inner construct complexity
to the outer construct complexity metric,
which would attempt to account for
the total complexity of understanding, maintaining the *root* function.

The third approach is to just ignore the complexity of the nested constructs.
These constructs are either rare, or very simple, or idiomatic.
Consider, for example, C++ lambda expressions.
This approach is default for C++ and C++-like languages.


Nested Control Structures
=========================

Nested control-flow structures, such as ``if``, ``while``, ``for``, and ``switch``,
add more context to the current block of a code
and increase the indentation.
The complexity (# of control paths) of such block can be measured by its CCN,
which is done by the Nesting Depth metric.
In contrast, the Nested Control Structures metric
simply counts the nesting of deepest control structures within a function block.
For coding styles that enforce "one-line-one-statement" rule
and switch-case on the same indentation level (ex. Qt style),
this metric is equal to ``indentation_level - 1``
(without consideration of multi-line statements or line-breaks).

.. code-block:: cpp

    int foo()
    {
            while (expr1) {

                    for (; expr2;) {

                            for (; expr3;) {

                                    if (expr4)
                                        return 42;

                            }

                    }
            }
            return -42;
    }

The CCN of the above example would be less than 10,
and it may pass other quality checks;
however, it is likely to be considered too nested (4 structures)
by most coding conventions
and get refactored through extraction.

The default value for the maximum depth of nested structures is set to be 3.
The idea is taken from the Linux kernel coding style:

::

    The answer to that is that if you need more than 3 levels of indentation,
    you're screwed anyway, and should fix your program.


IgnoreAssert: Ignoring the CCN within Assertions
================================================

Consider a simple use case for assertions in C++ code:

.. code-block:: cpp

    assert(expression && "More description...");

This line adds ``1 + CCN(expression)``
if the assertion is counted as a part of a function.

In defensive and design-by-contract programming,
assertions are used
to check invariants, pre-, post-conditions,
to explicitly state assumptions and contract,
and to defensively catch programmer errors.
Moreover, assertions with side-effects is a practice frowned upon,
and thus they are not expected to be a part of the flow of a function.
The function should stay and behave the same
if all the assertions are removed (in release mode, for example).

Ignoring assertions calculates the true, inherent complexity of a function.
However, design-by-contract codes may require death tests for assertions as well.
The CCN of assertions with messages,
which is equal to the delta of not ignoring the assertions,
is a good proxy for the number of death tests.

.. note::
    Even though it is possible to put a code with an arbitrary complexity within assertions,
    Lizard only discounts the CCN added by simple operators.

.. note:: The extension IgnoreAssert is only implemented for C-like languages.

.. note:: Some complexity analysis tools (ex. McCabe)
          may have an option to add 1 CCN per ``assert`` statement,
          treating ``assert`` as other conditional statements.
          This use case considers ``assert`` statements as an error handling mechanism
          mixed with or instead of 'proper' exceptions.
